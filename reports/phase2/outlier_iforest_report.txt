Isolation Forest Outlier Detection Analysis
Generated: 2025-12-05 16:47

Method Overview:
Isolation Forest uses random decision trees to detect anomalies.
Outliers are easier to isolate (fewer splits needed) than normal points.

Advantages:
- Multivariate: Considers all features together
- No distribution assumptions
- Detects complex patterns that univariate methods miss

Features analyzed: 7
Parameters: n_estimators=100, random_state=42

Contamination Parameter Experimentation:

Contamination = 0.05:
  Outliers found: 44,568 (5.00% of data)
  Score separation: 0.1769

Contamination = 0.1:
  Outliers found: 89,136 (10.00% of data)
  Score separation: 0.1527

Contamination = 0.15:
  Outliers found: 133,704 (15.00% of data)
  Score separation: 0.1387

Selected Contamination: 0.05

Justification:
- Highest score separation (0.1769)
- Clear distinction between anomalies and normal data
- Conservative approach with 5.00% flagged as outliers
- Captures multivariate anomalies (unusual feature combinations)

Key Findings:
- Isolation Forest detects patterns Z-Score misses (multivariate anomalies)
- Lower contamination (0.05) gives clearest signal
- Score separation indicates strong outlier vs. inlier distinction
