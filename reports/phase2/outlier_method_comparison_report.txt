Outlier Detection Method Comparison
Generated: 2025-12-05 17:22

Summary:
This analysis compares three outlier detection methods:
1. Z-Score (univariate statistical)
2. Isolation Forest (multivariate ML-based)
3. LOF (density-based)

Individual Method Results:

Z-Score: 31,098 outliers (3.49%)
Isolation Forest: 44,568 outliers (5.00%)
LOF: 18,267 outliers (2.05%)

Overlap Analysis:

Only Z-Score: 6,877 (0.77%)
Only Isolation Forest: 20,252 (2.27%)
Only LOF: 16,478 (1.85%)
Z-Score + Isolation Forest: 22,764 (2.55%)
Z-Score + LOF: 237 (0.03%)
Isolation Forest + LOF: 332 (0.04%)
All 3 Methods: 1,220 (0.14%)

Consensus Outliers (2+ methods agree): 24,553 (2.75%)

Key Findings:
- 1,220 outliers detected by all 3 methods (high confidence)
- 24,553 outliers detected by at least 2 methods (moderate-high confidence)
- Isolation Forest detected most outliers (multivariate approach)
- LOF detected fewest outliers (density-based, more conservative)
- Z-Score middle ground (univariate statistical)

Recommendation:
Use consensus outliers (2+ methods) for high-confidence anomaly detection.
This balances sensitivity with specificity.
