Correlation and Covariance Analysis Report
Generated: 2025-12-05 18:41

Correlation measures the strength of linear relationships between features.
Values range from -1 to +1:
  +1 = perfect positive correlation
   0 = no correlation
  -1 = perfect negative correlation

Strong Correlations (|r| >= 0.7):

Global_active_power ↔ Global_intensity: 0.999 (positive)
Global_active_power ↔ Sub_metering_3: 0.743 (positive)
Global_intensity ↔ Sub_metering_3: 0.732 (positive)

Key Findings:

Strongest correlation: Global_active_power ↔ Global_intensity (0.999)

Implications:
- Highly correlated features contain redundant information
- PCA will capture this correlation and reduce dimensionality
- Multivariate outlier detection benefits from understanding correlations
