LOF (Local Outlier Factor) Outlier Detection Analysis
Generated: 2025-12-05 17:15

Method Overview:
LOF detects outliers based on local density.
Points in low-density areas compared to neighbors are flagged as outliers.
LOF score > 1 indicates outlier (lower density than neighbors).

Advantages:
- Density-based: Detects local anomalies within clusters
- No distribution assumptions
- Good for data with varying densities

Features analyzed: 7

n_neighbors Parameter Experimentation:

n_neighbors = 10:
  Outliers found: 24,180 (2.71% of data)
  Average LOF score: 592102.1218

n_neighbors = 20:
  Outliers found: 18,267 (2.05% of data)
  Average LOF score: 176248.6949

n_neighbors = 50:
  Outliers found: 16,420 (1.84% of data)
  Average LOF score: 609050.4008

Selected n_neighbors: 20

Justification:
- Balanced approach for local and global anomaly detection
- Detected 18,267 outliers (2.05%)
- Standard parameter choice in density-based outlier detection
- Avoids over-sensitivity to very local variations

Key Findings:
- LOF detects points in sparse regions (low local density)
- Different from Isolation Forest (which uses tree isolation)
- Captures local context that univariate methods miss
