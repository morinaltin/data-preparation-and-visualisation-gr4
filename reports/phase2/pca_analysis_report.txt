Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Report
Generated: 2025-12-05 18:55

PCA reduces data dimensions while preserving variance.
It transforms correlated features into uncorrelated principal components.

Why PCA?
- Reduces 7 features to 2-3 components for visualization
- Removes redundancy (we found 0.999 correlation between power and intensity)
- Captures most important patterns in data

Explained Variance:

PC1: 47.46% (cumulative: 47.46%)
PC2: 23.02% (cumulative: 70.48%)
PC3: 14.29% (cumulative: 84.77%)
PC4: 9.75% (cumulative: 94.52%)
PC5: 5.47% (cumulative: 99.98%)
PC6: 0.02% (cumulative: 100.00%)

Components for 95% variance: 5

Component Interpretation:

PC1 (explained variance: 47.46%):
  - Global_intensity: 0.571
  - Global_active_power: 0.570
  - Sub_metering_3: 0.497

PC2 (explained variance: 23.02%):
  - Sub_metering_2: 0.713
  - Global_reactive_power: 0.678
  - Sub_metering_3: -0.151

PC3 (explained variance: 14.29%):
  - Voltage: 0.961
  - Sub_metering_3: 0.185
  - Global_active_power: 0.148

Key Findings:
- First 2 components capture 70.5% of variance
- Data can be visualized in 2D with minimal information loss
- PC1 likely represents overall power consumption
- PC2 likely represents power distribution patterns

Implications:
- Dimensionality reduction successful
- 2D visualization preserves most patterns
- Confirms feature redundancy (high correlation)
